Some mistake during my presentation :

- To present **to** you || To present (the audience will understand)
- Training : formation
ex : I'll follow a training from Microsoft
- Headquarter : Le si√®ge (de la compagnie)
- You are responsible **for** the data management

- If you want someone to change the slide, don't let a blank, just ask :
	- Next slide please
	- Can we move on to the next slide please ?

Grammar rule :
- 748 **million** euros
- **millions** of euros
